#Global genomic arrangement of bacterial genes is closely tied with the total transcriptional efficiency.

=Usage=
This software provides a new energy function (C+ value) for global arrangement of baterail operons. 

=Installation=
Simply put "GlobalGenomicConstrai2.0.tar.gz" in any directory, 
  * _$ tar zxvf GlobalGenomicConstrain2.0.tar.gz_
enter the folder "GlobalGenomicConstrain2.0" and type "make" then the compiled codes are within the same directory as the source.

=Inputs and outputs=
The major program in the provided package is `C+value`, it can parse two 
formats of files, discrete data and continuous data, and examples for each are provided. 

To see help and look at all available options.
  * _$ ./C+value -h_

To run the program just consider pathway and microarray information	
  * _$ ./C+value -i DATA/NC_000913.expr.all -j DATA/NC_000913.ptt  -o DATA/NC_000913.gi.operon -p DATA/NC_000913.pathway_
 
To identify the weight parameters dynamically [train the parameters (n, g, t) optimizing the accuracy of NAP binding sites mapping]
  * $ ./C+value -i DATA/NC_000913.expr.all -j DATA/NC_000913.ptt  -o DATA/NC_000913.gi.operon -p DATA/NC_000913.pathway -M_
  * _$ perl analysis_dynamic.pl DATA/NC_000913.expr.dynamic > DATA/NC_000913.expr.dynamic.stat_
