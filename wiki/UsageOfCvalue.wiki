#Global Genomic Arrangement of Bacterial Genes is Closely Tied with the Total Transcriptional Efficiency

=Usage=
This software is used to calculate the Global Genomic Constrain function (C value) of bacterial genome in this paper:Genomic arrangement of bacterial operons is constrained by biological pathways encoded in the genome (PMID: 20308592). 

=Installation=
Simply put "GlobalGenomicConstrain1.0.tar.gz" in any directory, 
  * $ tar zxvf GlobalGenomicConstrain1.0.tar.gz
enter the folder "GlobalGenomicConstrain1.0" and type "make" then the compiled codes are within the same directory as the source.

=Inputs and outputs=
The major program in the provided package is `*Cvalue*`. See help and look at all available options.
  * $ ./Cvalue -h
To run an example:	
  * $ ./Cvalue -j DATA/NC_000913.ptt  -o DATA/NC_000913.gi.operon -p DATA/pathway.example
